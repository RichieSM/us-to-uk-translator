US to UK Translator
===================

A Greasemonkey script which translates commonly used North American terms into their British equivalents.

For example:

| American | British |
|---|---|
| Scallions | Spring Onions |
| Hood | Bonnet |
| Sidewalk | Pavement |
| Your Turn Signal | To Indicate |
| Color | Colour |
| Broiler | Grill |

This may be particularly useful on websites such as Reddit, where commenters are largely American.
